# stock-info-scraper
python + beautiful soup web scraper to take some basic information off yahoo finance


You will need to install all the beautiful soup dependencies... make sure you install them where you're going to use them! To run the file from a shell, use the pip install tools from the command line (I think).
I built this in Thonny so I opened the terminal through Thonny and used the pip install there.

Once you have it open it is set by default to run a web scrape on 'V' which is the Visa stock. Just change the ticker to whatever you want and run it again to get data for a different stock!

Super simple and barebones... hoping to expand soon with some error checking and some fun analysis.
